  Hey! My name is Brendan, and I am a recent graduate with a B.S. in Computer Science - Cybersecurity. I work at Omnicell as a Software Engineer.
I plan on doing some cool projects in the future, like using machine learning to identify different species of birds from an image and much more! 
Stay tuned to see more about what I do, and feel free to contact me anytime about either business or casual inquires at my email, rae.brendan23@gmail.com
